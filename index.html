        <strong>Doctor:</strong> I'm sorry to hear that. When did the chest pain start, and have you experienced it before?

        <strong>Patient:</strong> It started about two days ago, and this is the first time I've had this kind of pain.

    <div class="message doctor">
        <strong>Doctor:</strong> Thank you for sharing that. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the pain, and is there anything that triggers or alleviates it?
